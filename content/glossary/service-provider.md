Service providers run [Watchers]({{< relref "watcher" >}}) to serve data to end users and join the [Service Provider Marketplace]({{< relref "service-provider-marketplace" >}}) to become part of a federated cache for serving Watcher data. Service providers generate revenue by serving Watcher data and benefit from a sustainable and decentralized operating model for DApp developers.
