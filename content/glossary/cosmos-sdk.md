Cosmos SDK is a framework for building application-specific blockchains in Go. The development paradigm is different from virtual-machine-based blockchains like Ethereum to avoid the limitations of the [smart contract]({{< relref "smartcontract" >}}) model. 

The [Laconic Network]({{< relref "laconic-network" >}}) is based on the Cosmos SDK.
