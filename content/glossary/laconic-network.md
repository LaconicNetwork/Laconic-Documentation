The Laconic Network (LN) is an ecosystem of validators, service providers, and DApp operators built upon the [Laconic Stack]({{< relref "laconic-stack" >}}). The goals of the Laconic Network include making blockchain data more accessible, providing independent verifiability via cross-chain cryptographic proofs, and serving as a decentralized system for matching DApps in need with service providers.
