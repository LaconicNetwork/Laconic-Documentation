Dapp developers enter into agreements with [Service Providers]({{< relref "service-provider" >}}) to gain fast and inexpensive access to caches of blockchain data produced by [Watchers]({{< relref "watchers" >}}). Developers use the [Laconic SDK]({{< relref "laconic-sdk" >}}) to query the Watchers.
