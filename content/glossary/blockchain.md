A blockchain is a chain of data blocks. A new blocks gets linked to the latest existing block by including a hash value of the existing block. As a result, the previous block cannot be tampered with anymore without invalidating the hash values of all subsequent blocks. 

A blockchain is typically stored in a distributed fashion. Multiple independent nodes hold a copy of the chain and work on adding new nodes to the chain. 

Blockchains are used as a distributed ledger that does not require its users to trust one single central authority. This ledger is typically used for performing transactions of virtual values ("coins" or "tokens") and for creating and fulfilling contracts through small apps called Smart Contracts.

Examples of blockchain-based systems: Bitcoin, [Ethereum](ethereum)
