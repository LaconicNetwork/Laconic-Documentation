Provability is the ability to prove that any data served by the [Laconic Network]({{< relref "laconic-network" >}}) is valid and untampered with. The [Laconic Stack]({{< relref "laconic-stack" >}}) preserves the provability of data by deriving new data sets from the [Ethereum]({{< relref "ethereum" >}}) [blockchain]({{< relref "blockchain" >}}) in a provable way and non-destructively converting that data into [IPLD]({{< relref "ipld" >}}) blocks.
