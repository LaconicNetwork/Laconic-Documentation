Ethereum is a [blockchain](blockchain) project with a focus on [smart contracts](smartcontracts), DApps, and DeFi.

Ethereum uses a proof-of-work mechanism for achieving consensus among nodes. 

Like other blockchain technologies, Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency called Ether. The purpose of this currency is to be able to pay for computation time required for performing transactions or calling smart contracts.
