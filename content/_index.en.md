The Laconic Network (LN) is an ecosystem of validators, service providers, and DApp operators built upon the Laconic Stack. The goals of the Laconic Network include making blockchain data more accessible, providing independent verifiability via cross-chain cryptographic proofs, and serving as a decentralized system for matching DApps in need with service providers.
