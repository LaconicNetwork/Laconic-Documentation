The Laconic Network (LN) is an ecosystem of validators, service providers, and DApp operators built upon the Laconic Stack. The goals of the Laconic Network include making blockchain data more accessible, providing independent verifiability via cross-chain cryptographic proofs, and serving as a decentralized system for matching DApps in need with service providers.

Referencing the ancient inhabitants of Laconia known for their more concise and terse style of speech, Laconic also describes a manner of speaking or writing that uses only a few words, often to express complex thoughts and ideas.

We believe it's the perfect name for the technology we're building, which elegantly simplifies the complexity of blockchain and accelerates DApp development.

## What sets Laconic apart?

The potential of blockchain technology is currently hampered by the middleware that connects it to actual applications. Some solutions already exist to index and store blockchain data, but they rely on centralized monopolist services to index and serve the data; and they accept and use data that cannot be cryptographically proven to be authentic and accurate. The Laconic Network stands apart by addressing precisely these two fundamental and existential problems â€” it indexes and serves data that is both decentralized and cryptographically provable.
