DApp developers need access to provable blockchain data in a manner that is scalable, fast, and cost effective. Laconic provides data access to DApps via [Watchers](/glossary/watcher/) which can be found via the [Watcher Registry](/glossary/watcher-registry/), generated from Solidity contract code, or written from scratch.

### Solution details

The main benefits for developers of working with the Laconic Network are:

- Fast set up time: minutes instead of months
- Perform data transformations at the Laconic Watcher level to custom tailor the data API for your DApp
- Freedom from Web2-style centralized services
- Data that can be verified using cryptographic proofs

### How to get involved

- Consider participating as a [Laconic Network Partner](/glossary/laconic-network-partner/) by becoming a [DApp Operator](/glossary/dapp-operator/).
- Develop a [Watcher](/glossary/watcher/) and make it available from the [Watcher Registry](/glossary/watcher-registry/).
