DApp developers that want to innovate the cutting edge DApps of tomorrow need access to scalable blockchain data in a manner that is fast and cost effective. Laconic removes the burden of blockchain data access for developers by providing easy access to cryptographically proven blockchain data. Additionally, DApp developers can benefit from joining the Laconic network to serve data, or by publishing [Watchers](/glossary/watcher/) to the [Watcher Registry](/glossary/watcher-registry/).

## Solution details

If you need access to blockchain data to develop the DApps of tomorrow, then consider developing on the Laconic platform:

The main benefits of working with the Laconic network are:

- No need to run your own Ethereum node to get access to the data that you need.
- Classic database indexing that enables you to query blockchain data for precisely the information that you need.
- Break free from dependence on Web2-style centralized services.
- Off-chain data that can be trusted using cryptographic proofs and IPLDp-based data structures that map back to the block header in a provable way.

## How to get involved

- Consider participating as a [Laconic Network Partner](/glossary/laconic-network-partner/) by becoming a [DApp Operator](/glossary/dapp-operator/).
- Develop a [Watcher](/glossary/watcher/) and make it available from the [Watcher Registry](/glossary/watcher-registry/).
