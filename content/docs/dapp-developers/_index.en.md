DApp developers need access to provable blockchain data in a manner that is scalable, fast, and cost effective. Laconic provides data access to DApps via {{< glossary "watcher/" "Watchers" >}} which can be found via the {{< glossary "watcher-registry/" "Watcher Registry" >}}, generated from Solidity contract code, or written from scratch.

### Solution details

The main benefits for developers of working with the Laconic Network are:

- Fast set up time: minutes instead of months
- Perform data transformations at the Laconic Watcher level to custom tailor the data API for your DApp
- Freedom from Web2-style centralized services
- Data that can be verified using cryptographic proofs

### How to get involved

- Consider participating as a {{< glossary "laconic-network-partner/" "Laconic Network Partner" >}} by becoming a {{< glossary "dapp-operator/" "DApp Operator" >}}.
- Develop a {{< glossary "watcher/" "Watcher" >}} and make it available from the {{< glossary "watcher-registry/" "Watcher Registry" >}}.
