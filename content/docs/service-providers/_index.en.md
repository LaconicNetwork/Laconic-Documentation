Service providers run {{< glossary "watcher/" "Watchers" >}} and serve data to end users. As a Laconic {{< glossary "service-provider/" "Service Provider" >}} you can join the Service Provider Marketplace to become part of a federated cache for serving watcher data. 

### Solution details

The main benefits of working with the Laconic network are:

- Join the Service Provider marketplace to be payed a fee by users that access the data that you serve.
- End-users can become ephemeral service providers by bonding an Approved Asset to run a cache in their browser.
