Service providers run {{< glossary "watcher/" "Watchers" >}} and serve data to end users. As a Laconic {{< glossary "service-provider/" "Service Provider" >}} you can join the Service Provider Marketplace to become part of a federated cache for serving watcher data. You generate revenue by serving this data and benefit from a sustainable and decentralized operating model for DApp developers.

### Solution details

The main benefits of working with the Laconic network are:

- Join the Service Provider marketplace to be payed a fee by users that access the data that you serve.
- End-users can become ephemeral service providers by bonding an Approved Asset to run a Watcher in their browser.
- Laconic Network aims to maintain decentralization while preserving the independence of its partners and service providers, and ensuring minimal interference from governance.
- The network aims to maintain an open, interoperable system that provides the highest quality services at the lowest costs for all parties.

Requirements:

- Comply with the laws and regulations of your local jurisdictions, in addition to any agreements formed within the Network or protocols prescribed in the Network bylaws.
