{{< glossary "validator/" "Validators" >}} provide Ethereum state data to service providers and can also serve in the role of service providers, running {{< glossary "watcher/" "Watchers" >}} as well. Laconic partners are the only possible Validators of the Laconic Network, and as partners are responsible for the overall direction of the network. Validators benefit by charging fees for producing blocks.

### Solution details

Validators provide a number of key services of the Laconic Network, including:

- Partner share auctions
- State injection from other blockchains
- Cross-chain asset management
- Payment channels
- Data pinning
- Watcher registration and discovery
- Service provider registration
- Fraud proofs

### How to get involved

If you're interested in becoming a Validator you must meet the following minimum requirements:

1. Serve a minimum amount of data, with a low percentage of failures or disputes (e.g. become a service provider)
2. Demonstrate participation in consensus
3. Inject state from Ethereum into Laconic Network (e.g. not only run a Watcher, but run the full Laconic Stack)
4. Must participate in the governance of a legal partnership; therefore any entity wishing to become a validator needs to provide KYC information to the partnership.
5. Comply with the laws and regulations of your local jurisdictions, in addition to any agreements formed within the Network or protocols prescribed in the Network bylaws.
