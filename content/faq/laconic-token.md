Yes. The Laconic Network Token (LNT) stores value for the network and enables users to pay for services. All fees from transactions and state channels pool in a vault as LNT.			

There won't be an airdrop or token sale-like event. Instead, the official token distribution divides LNT between service providers acting in the Validator partnership role, and users that perform liquidity mining (qualified users who serve data and get paid for it). In addition, a portion of LNT for Community Grants covers the network's legal, operational, and technical maintenance.
