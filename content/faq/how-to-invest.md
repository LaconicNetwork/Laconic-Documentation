Laconic will not be selling tokens to passive investors via SAFT (Sale Agreement for Future Tokens). Instead, you can invest in the network as an aligned stakeholder that passes through a series of incentivized testnets and auctions to become a network partner. Partners receive shares. For more information, contact the Director of Investor Relations.
